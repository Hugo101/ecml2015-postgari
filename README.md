# ecml2015-postgari

Poster for the [paper](http://www.di.uniba.it/~vergari/code/spyn.html) presented at [ECML-PKDD 2015](http://www.ecmlpkdd2015.org/).

It is heavily based on [textpos](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/textpos?lang=en) for absolute positioning the elements in a grid (however it feels like a hack). A grid layout can be seen in the pdf `postgari.grid.pdf`.

Based on the beamer theme [enziteto](https://github.com/arranger1044/enzitetobeamertheme).
